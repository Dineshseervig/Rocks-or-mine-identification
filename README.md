# Rocks-or-mine-identification
This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network [1]. The task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock. Hence building a ml model to classifier better!
